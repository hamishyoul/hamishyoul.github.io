## Introduction
This project is the development of a business website for the book review app, Bookcase.
The website includes basic information regarding the app, a beta testing sign-up form, and a release date schedule for when users can expect to download the app from both the AppStore and GooglePlay store.

## About the Bookcase smartphone app
The Bookcase smartphone app enables users to record and upload 1-minute video reviews of their favourite books to our database. Users log on to the Bookcase app to watch reviews from other users, upload their own reviews and find new books to read.

## Website design process
The website design process is aimed to be completed prior to the launch of the Bookcase smartphone application in late 2021.
